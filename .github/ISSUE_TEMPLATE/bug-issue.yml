        ## Logs

        Attaching log files is encouraged for reported bugs. You can find them in one of two ways:

        1. Open the screenshot directory (by right-clicking the \"Camera\" button if you have access to the client) and navigate one directory up and then open logs folder
        2. Navigate to `%userprofile%\.runelite\logs` on **Windows** or `$HOME/.runelite/logs` on **Linux** and **MacOS**

        You should upload both your `client.log` and `launcher.log` files, along with recently-created `jvm_crash_pid` files if this bug report is regarding the client crashing.
